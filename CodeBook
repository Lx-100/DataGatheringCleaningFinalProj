Data Dictionary -- UCI HAR Dataset

1. Introduction
This is the Code Book for output.txt, which contains the cleaned data of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data set after running run_analysis.R. The information and download link of the Data set can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

2. Variables

"activity"  -- activities measured
               there are six activities in total:
               Walking
               Walking_up
               Walking_down
               Sitting
               Standing
               Laying
               
"subject" -- 30 subjects/individuals are measured
             there are coded as nos. 1-30

Below are the col.s containing the average of the following variable, i.e. "avg_tBodyAcc.meanZ" is the average of the variable tBodyAcc.meanZ in the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data set. The detailed information on each of these variables can be found in the features_info.txt within the data set.
